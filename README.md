<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://i.imgur.com/9DtnaKz.png)

If you didn't know, our planet is changing. In many ways, our planet is improving positively, however, this is not true for every aspect surrounding this floating rock we call home. I wanted to create an application to visualize air pollution across the globe and spread awareness to the impending doom which is climate change.

Here's why:
* I was extremely curious in experimenting with API technologies such as Google Maps and the World Air Quality Index API
* I am a passionate humanitarian who values all human life, which is currently being threatened by globally increasing temperatures
* If only 1% of my network stumbles upon this web application and feels compelled to contribute to any climate change fund then I will have made a difference no matter how futile

Creating this web application was an extremely emotional rollercoaster with many ups, and many, many downs. I had never worked with external API technologies before and there are about five different Google Map React packages to choose from.

Regardless, I really hope you enjoy the interactive map and get to explore your favorite location's air quality index scores and forecasts!

### Built With
Below are all of the technologies, libraries, and packages I used to create this application. This may not be an all-encompassing list.
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
* [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
* [Chart JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chartjs-2)
* [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)
* [Google Maps API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-maps-react)
* [Google Geocoding](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview)
* [Google Places Autocomplete](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/autocomplete)
* [World Air Quality Index API](https://aqicn.org/api/)
* [Contextual Web API](https://contextualweb.io/)
* [Climate Score™ API](https://rapidapi.com/sameckhouse/api/climate-score)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To setup and run this project locally, please complete the following instructions.

### Prerequisites

You should know how to setup basic React apps and RoR APIs.

### Installation

1. Clone the 'Frontend' repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/johnloberger/Clyma-Frontend.git
```
2. Clone the 'Backend' repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/johnloberger/Clyma-Backend.git
```
3. Install packages on the back-end directory
```sh
bundle install
```
4. Create the database
```sh
rails db:create
```
5. Migrate the database
```sh
rails db:migrate
```
6. Seed the database if you want!
```sh
rails db:seed
```
7. Start the back-end server on a different port!
```sh
rails s -p 3001
```
8. Install NPM packages on the front-end directory and start the server!
```sh
npm install && npm start
```
9. Enjoy the application
